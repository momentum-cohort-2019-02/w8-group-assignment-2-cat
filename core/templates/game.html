steps:
thinking about it like posts from the Apile project...
the cards can be like posts (or maybe the stacks are like a post and the cards like comments?)
first they need to be shuffled, probably using an array
then we can 'for card in cards' and loop through the cards
clicking could appendChild to ask for right/wrong (or maybe this would be an 'input' popup?)
clicking 'next' or whatever could removeChild(current card) then appendChild(next card)
